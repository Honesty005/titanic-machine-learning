# Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is based on the Kaggle Titanic competition.  
The objective is to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The dataset contains information on Titanic passengers such as gender, passenger class, and family size.  
A Random Forest model was trained to classify whether a passenger survived.

## Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and encoding
- Model training using Random Forest
- Prediction and submission to Kaggle

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Results
Public Kaggle score: **0.77511**

## Notes
This project was created as a learning exercise to understand the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than male passengers, showing the importance of gender as a predictor.  
- Passenger class also influenced survival probability, with higher classes surviving more often.  
- The selected Random Forest model achieves a 0.77511 public score on Kaggle.
- The model confirms gender and passenger class were the strongest predictors of survival.
